Programming Assignment 01

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate working tkinter environment.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * As we progress in this course, your programs will need to
    draw on a canvas.  We use the tkinter package to do this.

  * The framework included with the assignment was originally
    written by Prof. Kamangar.  It has been heavily modified.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download HMWK_01_dalioba.zip from Blackboard.

  2. Unzip the file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_01_abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.

  5. Change the header lines in all of the Python files.
     (Put your name on line 1, your NetID on line 2, and the date
      on line 3.)

  6. Change the background color from yellow to something a bit more
     appealing to your taste.  If you make the background too dark,
     lines drawn in black won't show up, so you'll have to change
     the line color as well.  (Don't pick 'teal'.  That's MY
     color!)

  7. Change the cl_statusBar_frame.set() function so that it puts
     your NetID on the front of every message before it displays
     it.

  8. Run the framework, resize the canvas to 450, 450 and take a
     screenshot.  It should look like the AfterResize.png image,
     though with your NetID in the status bar message line.

  9. Click the 'Draw' button and take another screenshot.  It
     should look like the AfterDraw.png image, though with your
     NetID in the status bar message line.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_01_abc1234' directory (where
'abc1234' is replaced with YOUR NetID) and submit it on
Blackboard as your results for this assignment.

Your submission should be a zipfile that has exactly one item in
it, a directory named 'hmwk_01_abc1234' (where 'abc1234' is
YOUR NetID).  Inside that directory should be the source files
for your solution and the two screenshots that you took.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Remember that screenshots should be PNG files, not JPEG,
     JPG, GIF, ...  You don't want your images to look like
     pig poop.

  2. Crop your screenshots to just the single window.  I don't
     need to see everything else on your desktop.  (Yes, I have
     gotten full-desktop screenshots with somewhat embarassing
     items visible.  OK, maybe 'hilarious' is a better adjective
     here.  :)

  3. To get your NetID onto the front of the status bar messages,
     change ONLY the contents of the cl_statusBar_frame.set()
     function (at lines 110-112 in myWidgets.py).  Don't change
     every message to include your NetID.  (Yes, someone did that
     in a previous class.  :)

  4. Ensure that your screenshot after the canvas resize actually
     shows the canvas resize message.  Ensure that your
     screenshot after the draw actually shows the draw message.
     (You'll probably understand this cautionary hint better
     after you take a screenshot for the first time, I think.  :)

  5. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described above.
     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.
